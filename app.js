// Practice exercise 1.4
// Adding comments:
// 1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value.  Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line:
// let a = 10;
// 2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of  10.
// 3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this  will do.


// Set a variable value
var myVariable = "Hello, World!"

let a = 10;
console.log(a)

//Add a comment explaining what this  will do..................
//We use console.log() to print the value of myVariable to the console, and we added a comment explaining that this statement will log the value of myVariable to the console.


// 4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real  production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the  purpose of the file. 
/*
  This JavaScript file is a simple example demonstrating variable assignment
  and console logging. It sets a variable to the value 10 and then prints
  the value to the console. This code serves as a basic illustration for
  educational purposes.
